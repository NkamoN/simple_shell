Project checklist:
1. Display a prompt
2. Take user commands, commands always end with a new line
3. The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed
4. Simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections
5. Commands are made of only one word and no arguments will be passed to programs
6. If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
7. Handle Errors as well as the "end of file" condition
